# ftc_app-master
This version of the FTC SDK contains various useful libraries that can make programming an FTC bot even more of a piece of cake. These libraries are still to be tested on a real bot, but the underlying logic is the same as successful methods of previous years. You can find the code that I have made in the TeamCode folder and within the internal folder of the FtcRobotController. The layout activities are within the resource folder within FtcRobotController. There is a lot of work yet to be done on this before next year. Also, I am thinking of making a graphical interface that allows people to essentially draw their autonomous programs and select drive options from drop down menues auto-generating the code using the class-libraries in here.
